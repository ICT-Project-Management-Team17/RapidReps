# Rapid Reps

This is the version of the project in its initial state. We initially made the repos according to the tutorial in Week 5 but, now we have used the organization to organise our workflow. Although we should be developing on the master branches of our chosen repositories, we are developing on the repositories with our names and then we will make a PR to the organization repo and then merge the PR once everyone agrees with the PR. 

I will be developing and pushing commits on the Kamran Branch. I will then make a pull request to the master branch on Rapid Reps for the organization where everyone must review and approve the code before it is merged into the code-base.
